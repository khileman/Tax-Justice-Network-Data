## Data Sources  
### Tax Justice Network (TJN)
###Illicit Financial Flows Vulnerabilty Tracker
* TJN collects data from the World Bank and IMF on 207 countries but filters out a large amount of these based on global economic weight 
* Two main measures used here: Tax Haven Score and Financial Secrecy Ranking
* Tax Haven Scores is calculated using 4 different categories of law that indicate ability to evade taxes:   
    * Lowest available corporate income tax  
    * Loopholes and gaps, 
    * Transparency
    * Anti-avoidance  
    * Double tax treaty aggressiveness. 
    * 0 meaning does not allow for corporate tax abuse and 100 correlates with unrestricted corporate tax abuse. 
* Financial Secrecy Ranking is calculated across 151 jurisdictions based on 20 indicators of financial secrecy that revolve around governments' anti-money laundering laws and tax haven status
    * Weighted against Global Scale Weight based on economy size where 100 is perfectly unrestrained secrecy and 0 meaning no financial secrecy is allowed.
